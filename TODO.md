# TODO

* Responsive typography is hard - it's also the most important bit. I've chosen one way which I think is fairly sensible, however it's definitely something that needs serious thought at the beginning of a a project.
* Base styles for lists.
* Base styles for tables.
* Base styles for forms & inputs.
* Vertical padding & rhythm.
  - Should this be stored as variables or some sort of mixin? A combination of both?
  - I think these should limit choices to maintain consistency.
* Better directory and naming convention.
  - I'm less talking about BEM and stuff here but more like what's a 'component' and what partials belong in there?
  - Also I think there should be a denomination assigned to 'stateful' classes that are added via js. e.g. `.js--state__success`.
* I think these patterns are vaguely [ITCSS'ish](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/), is that a good idea?
